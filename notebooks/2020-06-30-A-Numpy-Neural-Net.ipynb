While they may not be as interpretable as models like random forests (at least not yet), we can still understand how networks process data to arrive at their predictions, and that's exactly what we'll do in this post. We'll build our own network from scratch, starting with logistic regression.\n",

We won't pretend to improve upon Sylvain's post; we just want to explain things in our own way to help us understand things a little bit more clearly. This will be the first of a series of posts in which we'll write our own DNN, CNN, and RNN. You can find the source code for all of these posts at [tinytorch](https://github.com/msarmi9/tinytorch)."
